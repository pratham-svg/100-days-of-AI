# 100 Days of AI Challenge 🚀

Welcome to my **100 Days of AI** journey! This repository documents my daily progress as I explore the vast world of Artificial Intelligence, from Large Language Models (LLMs) to Agentic Workflows.

## project Overview

This project is built using the **uv** package manager for fast, reliable dependency management. I am focusing on building practical applications using frameworks like **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and various state-of-the-art LLMs.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Package Manager**: [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- **Language**: Python 3.13+
- **Orchestration**: LangChain, LangGraph
- **Models**: Integration with OpenAI, OpenRouter, and local models.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- `day-01/`: initial setup
- `day-02-lcel-execution-model/`: Deep dive into LangChain Expression Language (LCEL).
- `day-03-memory-systems/`: Mastering Conversation Memories and State management.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Install uv**:

   ```powershell
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   ```

2. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone <your-repo-url>
   cd "100 days of AI"
   ```

3. **Set up Environment**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=your_proxy_url_here
   ```

4. **Run a script**:
   ```powershell
   uv run path/to/script.py
   ```
